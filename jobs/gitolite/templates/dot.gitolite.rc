# configuration variables for gitolite

# This file is in perl syntax.  But you do NOT need to know perl to edit it --
# just mind the commas, use single quotes unless you know what you're doing,
# and make sure the brackets and braces stay matched up!

# (Tip: perl allows a comma after the last item in a list also!)

# HELP for commands (see COMMANDS list below) can be had by running the
# command with "-h" as the sole argument.

# HELP for all the other external programs (the syntactic sugar helpers and
# the various programs/functions in the 8 trigger lists), can be found in
# doc/non-core.mkd (http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/non-core.html) or in
# the corresponding source file itself.
