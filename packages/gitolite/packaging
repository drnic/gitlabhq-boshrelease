cp -a gitolite/* ${BOSH_INSTALL_TARGET}/

# ./install
#     to run gitolite using an absolute or relative path, for example
#     'src/gitolite' or '/full/path/to/this/dir/src/gitolite'
# 
# ./install -ln [<dir>]
#     to symlink just the gitolite executable to some <dir> that is in
#     $PATH.  <dir> defaults to $HOME/bin if <dir> not specified.  <dir> is
#     assumed to exist; gitolite will not create it.
# 
#     Please provide a full path, not a relative path.
# 
# ./install -to <dir>
#     to copy the entire 'src' directory to <dir>.  If <dir> is not in
#     $PATH, use the full path to run gitolite commands.
# 
#     Please provide a full path, not a relative path.
# ./gitolite/install -to ${BOSH_INSTALL_PATH}/bin
